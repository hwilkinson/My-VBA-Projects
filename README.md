# My-VBA-Projects

This repository is created to store my VBA files relating to Excel projects that I have completed and represents years of 
Google searches, Stack Overflow research, book learning and borrowed scripts for reverse engineering and adaptation.

Any macros, or parts thereof, that are used are done so at your own risk.  I have tried to comment as much as possible to 
make the macros easier to understand.

Over the years, I have not kept a bibliography of everywhere and everyone that I have used as reference for my macros and have
a sincere desire to not take credit for others' work.  Of course, VBA is so widely used that code is repeated again and again
with few feasible ways to prove original work.  However, if you recognize your own code and would like to be recognized for 
your work, contact me with the proof and I will get you fairly represetned on here.
