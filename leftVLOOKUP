Excel Left Lookup Formula Overview

Excel's VLOOKUP function is used to find and return information from a table of data based on a lookup value that you choose.
Normally, VLOOKUP requires the lookup value to be in the left-most column of the table of data, and the function returns another field of data located in the same row to the right of this value.
By combining VLOOKUP with the CHOOSE function; however, a left lookup formula can be created that will:

    permits the lookup value to be chosen from any column in the data table
    return information located in any column to the left of the lookup value

Example: Using the VLOOKUP and CHOOSE Functions in a Left Lookup Formula
The steps detailed below create the left lookup formula seen in the image above.
The formula

 =VLOOKUP($D$2,CHOOSE({1,2},$F:$F,$D:$D),2,FALSE)

makes it possible to find the part supplied by the different companies listed in column 3 of the data table.
The job of the CHOOSE function in the formula is to trick VLOOKUP into believing that column 3 is actually column 1. As a result, the Company's name can be used as the lookup value to find the name of the part supplied by each company.
